Did you ever think a piano
Could fall on your head?
Do you look over
Your shoulder at all?
On the dark side of passion
Comes a taste for revenge
In the night is there
A rustle just under you bed?
Are the bolts dead?
Is the phone live?
Are you wide, wide
Awake?

Are you surprised a battle-ax
Has an ax to grind?
It's tit for tat
And all's fair in love
A mercenary man
With a dutful wife
The tables have turnerd
The plot is prime
Are the lights on?
'Cause the bet's off
Are you wide, wide
Awake?

I gotcha comin'
I gotcha goin'
The IRS
Is in your mail
Your edifice is starting
To crack and peel

Your girlfriend is starting
To panic and steal
Whatever's left
Of a small piece
Of a small pie
Of a small man
With a much smaller life

Did you mistake "fat and happy"
For stupid and blind?
Do you know
That I knew from the start?
A tooth for a tooth
An eye for an eye
This taxidermist
Has skinned you alive
Are the dogs in?
Cause the cat's out
Are you wide, wide
Awake?
